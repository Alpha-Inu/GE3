# A collection of my texture replacements for GOD EATER 3 if/when I make them.

Unpack Guide

1. Extract "GE3-Extractor.zip"
2. Move  "GE3-Extractor.exe", "lz11.dll", and "zlib1.dll" to  	"\GOD EATER 3\resource\target\win\pack\mount\retail"
3. Drag and drop "archive_patch10.pk" on "GE3Packer.exe" wait for it to finish unpacking
4. Do the same with "archive00.pk" and "archive01.pk" ~ SEPARATELY ~ THE UNPACKER WILL NOT DO ALL 3 AT ONCE
5. It will create 3 new folders: "archive_patch10" "archive00", and "archive01", Open each one and merge the \resources\ folders together
6. Once you have those merged into a single resources folder, merge that into the resources folder in your game directory.
7. Delete or move all .pkh files from the original location - the game does not seem to care about the .pk files, just leave the .pfs files alone
8. Run the game, if its running normally the unpack is success.
9. Now you can begin replacing textures.

See the Info.md inside each directory to see the specific filenames of the textures you will be replacing<br>
Updates and additions are pushed to Github the moment I get a good test run and preview screenshot.
