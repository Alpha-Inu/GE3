Changes the background on the company startup banners to black instead.<br>

Currently there is a bug with "logo_BNE_for_ps3.dds" where a white bar<br>
is visible at the top of the screen. I will fix it when I figure out the<br>
cause of the problem as I can't find anything wrong within the texture.

Possible why's:

  The bar was always there, but hidden by the white background<br>
  Error caused by incorrect choice of compression
  
These go in "\resource\target\win\texture"
