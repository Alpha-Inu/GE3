# DDS Textures

Many of the UI, menu and special event icons for the game use the industry standard DDS files and 
can be opened in GIMP or Microsoft Visual Studio but some are compressed with DX10 and would
require a more aggressive tool such as paint.NET. 

I primarily use paint.NET for this task as GIMP's DDS plugin is severely outdated. Most of the 
textures you will find here I have recompressed with BC6/7. paint.NET is the only tool I know of 
that is able to do this.

Place .dds files in "\resource\target\win\texture"
